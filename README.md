# PIPP-PD-sampling

PD_generation.ipynb is used to create synthetic PD example. this may be omited if you input a PD as a kx2 numpy array file. If omited, all codes my be screend to adjust the emperically chosen parameters.

Naming convention for the RJ-MCMC samplers is the 'interaction'-'spatial'.

If recreating, run RunningAvg_Voro.ipynb before RunningAvg_Gauss.ipynb to transfer over data files for images
To run only the runnign averages, files in PDchains folder must be unzipped and be placed in the PDchains folder.
